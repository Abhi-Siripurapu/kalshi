# Setup Required

## Missing Private Key

The system needs your Kalshi private key file saved as `kalshi-key.pem`.

**To get your private key:**
1. Log into your Kalshi demo account
2. Go to Account & Security → API Keys  
3. Click "Create Key" or use existing key
4. Download the private key file (.key or .pem format)
5. Save it as `kalshi-key.pem` in this directory

## API Key Status
- ✅ API Key ID set: `6d7e4138-afce-47a3-ace2-495d6d801410`
- ❌ Private key file missing: `kalshi-key.pem`

Without the private key, the system cannot authenticate with Kalshi's API.

## Alternative: Test Mode
For now, I can test the basic system components that don't require Kalshi authentication.
