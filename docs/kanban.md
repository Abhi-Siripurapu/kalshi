# 6-Day Build Kanban Board

## Day 1 - Foundations âœ… COMPLETED

### DONE âœ…
- [x] Architecture decisions (DECISIONS.md)
- [x] Repo scaffolding and directory structure
- [x] Docker-compose setup with services
- [x] Canonical data schemas (docs/schemas.md)
- [x] Fee calculation rules and test cases (docs/fees.md)
- [x] Market matching policy (docs/matching.md)
- [x] Target market coverage plan (docs/coverage.md)
- [x] Risk management policies (docs/risk.md)
